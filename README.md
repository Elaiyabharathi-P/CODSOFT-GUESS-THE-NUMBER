# Guess Number Game

A simple Java program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the number.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Guess the number between 1 and 100.
3. Receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.

## How to Run


git clone https://github.com/Elaiyabharathi-P/CODSOFT-GUESS-THE-NUMBER.git

javac GuessNumber.java
java GuessNumber


## Game Logic
